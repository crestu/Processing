# Processing

This repository is dedicated to graphics and animations created with Processing. Processing is a Javascript based graphics library.

Creative coding was my first introduction to tech (and unknowingly front end development) and continues to be a hobby of mine. The goal of this repository is to document progress I make within this framework, as well as archive tutorials and lessons I've completed.
